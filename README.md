This code runs on Apple ][.  Currently it supports the Virtual ][ emulator and shell scripts for VS Code build tasks are included along with AppleScript to automatically assemble the code, add it to an Apple ][ disk image, and run under the emulator.  This is all on a Mac.  If you're on another platform, feel free to contribute scripts for other emulators.
